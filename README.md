# Caesar Cipher Solution

This is a solution to the caesar cipher problem.

## Overview

### The challenge

A caesar cipher should be implemented which takes a string and a shift factor and then outputs the modified string.

From Wikipedia:

In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The mehtod is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.

## My Process

### Built with

- Ruby

### What I Learned

I learned about the syntax of loops, conditionals, and arrays in Ruby.

### Continued development

I am interested in developing a front end for this piece of logic with new tools and frameworks as I learn them.

### Useful resources
